<h2>SII Canada public shared spaces</h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This pages is created to share the references used by SII Canada in different project proposals and reports of our R&D activities. 
These references can be written by our team, or can be open-source documents that should be renamed to meet the requirements of the Calls of projects. 
For the latter, SII Canada is not the author of these papers, and we do not have any rights for them. 
The original name of these documents can be found in the "Reference list" section below. 
The document written by our team will be also available for any consultations, however, please make sure to use the correct citation in your work.
For more information, please contact quang.nguyen@siicanada.com. </p>
